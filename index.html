                    Welcome to my basic portfolio page. I started this site to showcase some of my homework during my class in UC Davis Coding Bootcamp. I love to learn and explore new things specially in technology. You can check out my Portfolio Page. If you have any questions
                    please feel free to Contact Me.

                <p>
                    My most recent interest that is worth talking about is coding. It was a year ago when I started becoming very interested in coding. I was never interested in coding as a matter of fact i'm avoiding it because i dont really like it. Actually, I was the
                    person who told every one that "I don't code and i dislike coding" I started realizing that some part of my career as an I.T. person that i need to learn coding, I worked as a System Administrator and some part or most of the part
                    of my role is to create a script for monitoring and services. thats why i decided to enroll for fullstack developer program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many things that I enjoy doing. So many I don't want to talk about all of them right here. Enjoy checking out my portfolio! Also, I look forward to hearing from you!
